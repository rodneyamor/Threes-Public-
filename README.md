# Triples-Public-
A remake of the popular mobile game where players combine numbered tiles in a grid to create higher-numbered tiles. Implemented using Model-View-Controller design pattern. Has swipe gesture functionality. 


Because this was a class project, I am not posting the code in public. The actual project is stored in a private repository.
